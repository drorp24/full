        ☐ Make a vertical stepper @started(19-01-15 18:19)
        ☐ Create Formik.js, which is a formikation of the Yup.js basic form
        ☐ Use MUI's new 'system' library - or new <Box /> - to apply theme styling w/o defining any custom styles (no use of makeStyles)
        ☐ Replace styles pass-around with styles taken from a globally defined theme
        ☐ Apply MD style to the forms' fields by using MUI components for the form
        ☐ Add a title, complete the page to adhere to MD's self-select model
    Forms: 
      HomeMade:
        ☐ Keep the home-made version (Yup.js), don't override it with Formik
