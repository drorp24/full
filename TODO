        Notes:
          ☐ I want to show as many UI widgets as possible already in the first page
          ☐ I want the pages to look designed and *app-like* as much as possible
        Center selection:
          ☐ Make 'center' a google location box with:
            ☐ https://github.com/hibiken/react-places-autocomplete#readme 
          ☐ Add a 'look around' switch to first page, that once set, populates center with user's address
        Currency selection:
          ☐ Make currency selection autocompletable using:
            ☐ https://material-ui.com/demos/autocomplete/#react-autosuggest
            ☐ https://github.com/moroshko/react-autosuggest 
          ☐ Use a long (preferrably: all) list of coins
          ☐ Try using flags if svg and doesn't hit performance
        Live rates:
          ☐ Show interbank live rate as soon as currency pair is selected
        Other:
          ✘ Consider adding help (?) pages - only if it improves things @cancelled(19-02-07 15:36)
    Search:
      GraphQL Server:
        ☐ Update the GraphQL resolver  / mongoose query to address the form's content
        ☐ Create the live, subscription-based rate server-side query 
        ☐ Update the crypto subscription query (server)
      GraphQL Client:
        ☐ Update the GraphQL client gql query to address the form's content
        ☐ Create the live, subscription-based rate client-side query 
        ☐ Update the crypto subscription query (client)
    List:
      Merchants list:
        ☐ Either place the gql query in the component file (think CC-in-JS) or make the query accept parameters
        ☐ Respond to query result by displaying a (unedited yet) list of merchants
        ☐ Use grid to style the list items (https://material-ui.com/layout/grid/#complex-grid) 
      Endless Scrolling:
        ☐ Read about endless scrolling / lazy loading best practices in react
        ☐ Try to find an npm package for that, look at 'react-window' and others (npms) 
        ☐ Use <ErrorBoundary>, <Suspense> and React.lazy to lazy-load new merchants when scroll reaches page bottom
    Map:
      ☐ Create a google map component whose center is user's location displaying nearby merchants
      ☐ Add walking / driving instructionswhether to use header or footer (read a bit?)
    Header / Footer / Theme:
      ☐ Create a branded header
      ☐ Create a footer with action icons
      ☐ Place a list/map toggle icon on either of them, and let it toggle b/w map | list 
      ☐ Consider making a grey background, or better make two themes, and let the user toggle b/w them
    Card:
      ☐ Create a merchant card
      ☐ Make a list click link t   o mer chant's card
    Information:
      ☐ Make a reviews page like the one I had in Cambiu
      ☐ Make a live ws-based crypto graph for 3 crypto currencies
    Menu:
      ☐ Consider creating a left-drawer menu
  Later:
    https:
      ☐ Support httpsß
    Server-side rendering:
        Styles:
          ☐ server-render styles (https://www.styled-components.com/docs/advanced#server-side-rendering)
          ☐ Avoid discrepancy with client-rendered styles (requires https://www.styled-components.com/docs/tooling#babel-plugin)
    Performance:
      ☐ What is the reason for the 21M
      ☐ Why the unresposiveness and wrong selects
      ☐ Roboto was fetched with all variants
      ☐ Why is Form called for every keystroke
    Desktop:
      ☐ When on desktop, confine display to a left pane and show map with merchants (a-la google maps, old cambiu)
