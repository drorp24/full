  // ! Components' useSelector variables are essentially props: whenever each of them change, the entire component gets re-rendered
  // (indeed that's how old 'connect' communicates them to a component)
  // that means that:
  // - each useSelector var should be assigned to the lowest (most granular) key in the redux store object
  //   That guarantees that the component gets re-rendered only upon changes it cares about, and not re-rendered unnecessarily
  //   (e.g., if I assigned a variable to the entire 'form' selector then FormContainer would have been rerendered each and every keystroke)
  //
  // - the price to pay for assigning the lowest required keys, is that they don't always exists by the time they are first accessed
  //   in my case, for instance, the 'form.values' properties are dynamically generated at one of the useEffects,
  //   but another useEffect (quote) asks about the value of quote useSelector (i.e., store.form.values.quote) when store.form is still null
  //   in such cases the (... || {}) notation can save if statements.
  //
  // ! useEffects' dependency variables are exactly the same: props that trigger re-invocation whenever their values change
  // The fact useEffects are re-invoked whenever any of their dependencies change enables using them as event handlers,
  // but such that depend on data rather than on a user gesture and such that don't need to be linked to any component.
  // I'm doing this here in the 'quote useEffect', that updates the coins list whenever quote currency changes.
  // if 'quote' is not impressive enough example to the power of the dependency array (since I could have used 'onChange' in this case),
  // there are dependencies that don't sit on any component (e.g., schema) and would therefore not be possible with any useEffect
  // and then there is the fact that any useEffect can depend on a multitude of data, which isn't possible with onChange either.
  //
  // ! every useEffect invocation will have a component re-render preceeding it
  // ! or: why is FormContainer being re-rendered upon every keystroke in the 'quote' field
  // The above rule holds even if the useSelector vars doesn't seem to require any re-render of the component, just a side calculation
  // For instance: 'quote' changes trigger re-generation of the coins list.
  // Aparently, this doesn't require any re-rendering of FormContainer (maybe not a good example but never mind)
  // but since quote useEffect depends on 'quote', every keystroke in the 'quote' field will re-invoke it
  // and since that quote useEffect belongs to the FormContainer, FormContainer itself will be re-rendered every keystroke in the 'quote' field
  //
  // I could have separated the only part of the form that cares about lists ('quote' field) into its own component
  // and define the 'quote' useSelector as well as the corresponding useEffect (setLists) there
  // but then I would miss the entire flexibility of my Form 'library' which is completely dynamic based on configuration
  // I could have passed 'quote' as a prop into some child of FormContainer, which would make only that child re-render
  // but then I would again defeat the purpose of having a Form component which is entirely dependant on configuration.
  // Even if I had done any of these, I would merely compete with React's own 'diff' mechanism,
  // which sees that only the minimal part of the DOM (if ever) is updated.

  const lists = useSelector(store => store.lists)
  const populated = useSelector(store => store.app.populated)
  // Unlike lists and app selectors, whose properties are hard-coded hence initialized,
  // form.values' properties are unknown initially as they're dynamically built
  const quote = useSelector(store => (store.form.values || {}).quote)

  // ! useCallback only when needed
  // The recommendation is to hoist functions that donâ€™t need props or state outside of your component,
  // and pull the ones that are used only by an effect inside of that effect.
  //
  // Any function that is used by one single useEffect only should be defined in it
  // In which case it doesn't need to be wrapped in useCallback (nor will it be able to)
  //
  // Doing so will
  // - save the need to wrap every such function with useCallback
  //   (otherwise required to prevent that function from changing with each component rerender, which would also trigger the useEffect)
  // - will enable seeing which variable that function depends upon
  //   (e.g., it could be w/o arguments but depend on a closure var which, if not included as dependency, would create a bug)
  // - will enable using variables local to the useEffect (closures again)
  //
  // Below: updateList and updatePopulated are required by multiple effects, hence defined here and wrapped with useCallback.
  const updateList = useCallback(
    ({ name, list, quote = 'USD' }) => dispatch(setList({ name, list, quote })),

    dispatch,
  ])

  // ! Using redux-persist to cache expensive metadata
  //
  // Generally, useEffect should refrain from updating any variable it is dependant upon,
  // as updating a variable it depdends upon will immediately re-invoke that useEffect again.
  //
  // any useEffect will be invoked as many times as it updates any variable it depends upon.
  // And if there's nothing to stop that useEffect from updating, it will keep updating and be re-invoked forever.
  // This happened to me when I attempted to locate the user address in an http environment.
  //
  // However, when redux-persisted values need to be kept intact, there is no other way.
  // redux-persisted values are hydrated already by the time the initialization useEffect is called,
  // and its the useEffect's responsibility to not override the persisted values.
  // To achieve that, it needs to check on every variable that requires persistance, whether or not that variable is populated already,
  // so it doesn't override any variable that we want persisted.
  // If the variable doesn't require persistance (e.g., 'location/address') then no such if statement should be placed.
  //
  // It doesn't matter if it asks about the persisted variables themselves or uses different set of variables as I did ('populated'),
  // either way, it needs to update the very variables it checks, which results in immediate re-invocation.
  //
  // But here's the big thing:
  // Not only these re-invocations are inevitable in order to not override redux-persisted values,
  // they happen only once in the lifecycle of localStorage, where redux-persist keeps its persisted values.
  //
  // That means, that all the metadata that the form requires - most of which never changes - awaits ready at the device's memory
  // after just one run - saving the need to ever re-generate them in the lifecycle of the app.
  // In fact, I'm pretty confident that in mobile, these values will keep intact b/w runs (practically forever),
  // as redux keeps them in localStorage, not sessionStorage.
  //
  // In my case, such metadata includes a lot of info which is hard to get by and never changes.
  //
  // - entire list of coins with USD quotes - that require a heavy async API to get,
  // - form's state which is dynamically-generated from configuration (structure) but never changes
  // - and naturally the user's keyed data
  //
  // In a sense, this acts like service worker for meta data.

    // getCurrencies on the other hand is an API that almost always succeeds.
    // It fails (only) if WiFi signal is weak, in which case app would fail anyway.
    // Generally when an API fails due to weak network signal, it's often easier to just refresh and try again
    // rather than filling the code with iterators over every API.
    // 'if (!empty)' ensures we can try again by refreshing.
