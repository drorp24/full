// TODO: Must try the function way
// To beat this thing once and for all, I must try the function way first (only then record my learnings)
// because what I've done here and in client.js is an ugly workaround instead of the solution.
// While the if's saved me from the problems, I don't want *any* of that code, nor client.js, to run on the server
// (effectively, that's what I'm doing here, defining a lot of const's and then doing nothing unless we're inTheBrowser).
//
// I don't have a clue how this file got to be run on the server at all, let alone before the server/index etc
// It's not in the tree of calls!
// What's more puzzling is that it did succeed in ssr quite many times before.
// I do notice that the code is not included in any function.
// I do notice that *all* issues, which I gradually fixed, occured at Merchant.js line 62 which is:
// import { BrowserContext } from '../../index'
// - and this explains why the change in behavior: this is indeed a new line!
// - so app/src/index.js *was* in the tree after all. It's Merchant who put included it there.
// I'm including the index for the first time....got it ðŸ¤“
// By importing BrowserContext from app/src.index.js I somehow made the other definitions be evaluated too, though
// they aren't related.
// TODO:
// - place BrowserContext code in a file of its own, so as to not import anything from app/src/index.js
// - revert the fixes I just did (keep them of course befirehand) and check if the problems ceased to exist
// - consider moving the device/browser details to redux instead of using BrowserContext (only if 1 min work!)

// And plenty of other (not needed) files too, only they didn't refer to 'window' so no complaint was heard
// (registerServiceWorker did, and I had to fix it - which was indeed odd to me then)

// That info would also be persisted, but I'm not sure I'd want all device properties to be persisted.
// And I'd have to exclude it from redux initialization, as it happens on the server as well, where all this info is unavailable
// The fact this file runs only on the client by definition made me choose putting this logic here and not in redux.
